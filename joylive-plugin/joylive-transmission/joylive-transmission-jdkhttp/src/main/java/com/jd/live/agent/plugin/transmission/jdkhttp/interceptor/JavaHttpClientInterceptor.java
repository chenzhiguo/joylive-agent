/**
 * Interceptor for the Java HTTP Client's request builder implementation.
 * This class uses reflection to access and modify the headers of HTTP requests
 * constructed by the internal {@code HttpRequestBuilderImpl} class.
 *
 * <p>Due to module encapsulation in Java 9 and above, direct access to the internal
 * HTTP request builder is not possible. This interceptor bypasses these restrictions
 * to allow header manipulation for outgoing HTTP requests.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: This interceptor is designed to work with specific versions of the JDK
 * where {@code HttpRequestBuilderImpl} and its method {@code setHeader} are present.</p>
