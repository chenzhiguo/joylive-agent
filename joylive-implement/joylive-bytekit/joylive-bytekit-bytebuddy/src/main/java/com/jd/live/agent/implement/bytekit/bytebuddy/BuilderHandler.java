/**
 * Defines a handler responsible for configuring the {@link AgentBuilder}, which is part of the Byte Buddy library.
 * This interface is marked as a functional interface, indicating that it is intended to be implemented by a single
 * abstract method (SAM) instance, such as a lambda expression or method reference.
 *
 * <p>The {@link BuilderHandler} is an extension point in the instrumentation process, allowing for custom
 * configurations of the {@link AgentBuilder}. This is crucial for defining how classes are intercepted and
 * modified at runtime. Implementations of this interface can specify class loaders, modules, and
 * specific classes to instrument, among other configurations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is annotated with {@code @Extensible}, suggesting that it supports being extended
 * or implemented through the SkyWalking agent's plugin mechanism. This allows for dynamic addition of
 * instrumentation logic without modifying the core agent code.</p>
 *
 * @since 1.0.0 Initial version of the interface.
